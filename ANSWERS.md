## Questions

Go to `localhost:3000/teachers` in your browser; why does this not work?

This doesn't work because there is no get request that routes to teachers in routes.rb'


What type of request did your browser just perform?

My browser just performed a get request.


Go back to `localhost:3000/teachers/new`; submit the form again. What URL do you end up at?

I end up in `localhost:3000/teachers`.


Why does `localhost:3000/teachers` work now?

This works because when we submit a form, a post request is issued and the link gets rendered so we can visit it.
